# Step 2 Check Settings, and That the Controller and Devices are Reachable

* 00_settings - Display configuration settings, and print the documentation of the `settings` module, the location of the module the configuration is loaded from, and the configuration data, including the co-ordinates of the Controller and network devices.

```bash
$ ./00_settings.py
cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201

settings.config:
    odl_server:
         url_prefix = https://198.18.1.25/controller/restconf/
         username = token
         password = 51ae0147-c0ac-3372-9031-2616a9783a34
    network_device:
        lax
             username = cisco
             password = cisco

             address = 198.18.1.51
             ...
```

* 00_controller - Connects to the controller and authenticates, as a basic sanity check that the controller is reachable and responding to requests.

```bash
$ ./00_controller.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
cosc authentication parameters:
   username = ***
   scope = sdn
   password = ***
   grant_type = password
cosc authentication status code: 201
odl_url_prefix: https://198.18.1.25/controller/restconf/
odl_username: token
odl_password: e9780cf1-c8da-360f-ba91-50e52b0a9394
status code: 200
status: OK

```

* 00_devices - Connect to each configured Network Device and display the details of the local socket, from which you are connecting, and the remote socket to which you are connecting on the device. This helps establish whether the configured Network Devices are reachable. Note that it is perfectly possible that the Network Devices are NOT reachable from where this script would be run, but that the controller is, and that the controller can see the Network Devices.

```bash
$ ./00_devices.py 

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
lax ('10.16.16.165', 56236) --> ('198.18.1.51', 830)
...
```
