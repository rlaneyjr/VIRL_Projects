# Step 3 Mounting and Unmounting Netconf Devices

* 01_inventory_mount - Cause the server to use Netconf to mount the XRv instances in the configuration file.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_mount.py 
cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function device_mount in module basics.inventory

device_mount(device_name, device_address, device_port, device_username, device_password)
    Add the specified network device to the inventory of the Controller.
device_mount(lax, cisco, cisco, 830, 198.18.1.51)
...
```

At this point you can go onto the next step, [Displaying the Connected Devices and Inventory](2.md), or explore more in this section below.

* 01_inventory_mounted - Show which devices have been mounted.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_mounted.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_mounted in module basics.inventory

inventory_mounted()
    Names of network devices mounted on the Controller.
    
    Output a list of names.
    Mounted devices are a subset of the inventory.
    Mounted devices can be connected or not.

['sjc', 'por', 'sfc', 'min', 'sea', 'san', 'lax', 'kcy']
```

* 01_device_dismount - Show how to dismount a given device.

```bash
cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function device_dismount in module basics.inventory

device_dismount(device_name)
    Remove one network device from the inventory of the Controller.
    
    It is not necessary for the device to be connected. 
    The outcome is undefined if the device is not already mounted.

device_dismount(sjc)
```

* 01_inventory_unmounted - Show which devices in the configuration are not mounted. Note that this example shows the state after the `01_device_dismount` script was used to unmount a device. 

```bash

$ ./01_inventory_unmounted.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_unmounted in module basics.inventory

inventory_unmounted()
    Names of network devices not mounted on the Controller.
    
    Returns a list.

['sjc']

```

* 01_device_mount - Mount a device in the configuration.  Note that this example shows the state after the `01_device_dismount` script was used to unmount a device. 

```bash
$ ./01_device_mount.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function device_mount in module basics.inventory

device_mount(device_name, device_address, device_port, device_username, device_password)
    Add the specified network device to the inventory of the Controller.

device_mount(sjc, cisco, cisco, 830, 198.18.1.57)
```

* 01_device_mounted - Show if a given device is mounted.

```bash
$ ./01_device_mounted.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function mounted in module basics.inventory

mounted(device_name)
    Determine whether a single device is mounted on the Controller.
    
    Return True if mounted.

is mounted(lax): True
```

* 01_inventory_dismount_atomic - Show how to scan for connected devices whilst dismounting devices. Since this happens asynchronously, there is a potential race-condition to monitor for.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_dismount_atomic.py
cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
device_dismount(sjc)
...
Dismounted 8 device(s), slept for 0 seconds
```

* 01_device_dismount_unmounted - Sample usage of function 'device_dismount(device_name)' on an unmounted device, that is not configured, to test that there is an expected exception.

```bash
$ ./01_device_dismount_unmounted .py
cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function device_dismount in module basics.inventory

device_dismount(device_name)
    Remove one network device from the inventory of the Controller.
    
    It is not necessary for the device to be connected. 
    The outcome is undefined if the device is not already mounted.

device_dismount(dark)
exception: True

```

<<<<<<< HEAD
* 01_inventory_unreachable - Mount a network device that is intentionally unreachable and show that the status is as expected.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_unreachable.py
cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Verify absence of unreachable device.
grox in inventory: False
grox is mounted: False

Discover effect of mounting unreachable device.
device_mount(grox, 192.168.0.999, 830)
grox is connected: False
grox is mounted: True

```

* 01_inventory - Show devices in inventory.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory.py
cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function inventory in module basics.inventory

inventory()
    Names of network devices known to the Controller.
    
    The inventory includes all mounted devices.
    The inventory excludes all unmounted devices.
    The inventory includes all connected devices.
    The inventory can contain unconnected devices.
    
    The inventory can contain devices that are introduced independently of the
    Controller's mounting process. 
    Examples of these devices are Open Flow switches.
    Such devices have the following characteristics:
    - not considered to be 'mounted' (see function 'inventory_mounted')
    - no 'control' information available (see function 'inventory_control')
    - not considered to be 'unmounted' because there are no settings configured
      (see function 'inventory_unmounted')
    - cannot be mounted (because not unmounted)
    - cannot be dismounted (because not mounted)
    
    Returns type is list, which may be empty.

['openflow:1', 'por', 'openflow:6', 'openflow:7', 'openflow:4', 'openflow:5', 'lax', 'openflow:2', 'openflow:3', 'sjc', 'sfc', 'grox', 'min', 'sea', 'san', 'kcy']
```
