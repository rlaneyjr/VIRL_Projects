# Step 4 Displaying the Connected Devices and Inventory

* 01_inventory_connected - Show the connected devices:

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_connected.py 
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_connected in module basics.inventory
inventory_connected()
    Names of network devices connected to the Controller.
    Output a list of names.
    Connected devices are a subset of the inventory.
['sea', 'por', 'san', 'lax', 'sjc', 'sfc', 'kcy', 'min']
```

The output above indicates that the controller has mounted the XRv devices, and that all devices connected properly. If you do not see that they connected properly, try again. It can take a several minutes for all of the network elements to mount and connect.

After that, there are additional sets of scripts to examine certain components and set properties on those components, as appropriate.

* 01_inventory_not_connected - Show which devices are mounted, but not connected to the controller.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_not_connected.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...
cosc authentication status code: 201
Python Library Documentation: function inventory_not_connected in module basics.inventory

inventory_not_connected()
    Names of network devices mounted on the Controller but not connected to the Controller.

['openflow:1', 'openflow:6', 'openflow:7', 'openflow:4', 'openflow:5', 'openflow:2', 'openflow:3']
```

* 01_inventory_summary_html - Print a HTML table of the inventory with the connected status and number of Netconf capabilities.

        <td>openflow:1</th>
        <td style="text-align:center">False</td>
        <td style="text-align:right">5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>por</th>
        <td style="text-align:center">True</td>
        <td style="text-align:right">42</td>
    </tr>
   ...

</table>
```

* 01_inventory_summary - Print a list of the inventory, with the connected status and number of Netconf capabilities.

```

* 01_inventory_control - Show the device control, i.e. connection details and credentials, data for each device in the inventory.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_control.py

cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
...

inventory_control()
    List the DeviceControl for every mounted device.
    
    Return type is 'list of DeviceControl'.
    If no devices are mounted the list returned is empty.

DeviceControl fields:
	device_name
	address
	port
	username
	password

inventory_control():
	 sjc 198.18.1.57 830 cisco cisco

* 01_inventory_integrity - Integrity check of all inventory related function output.

```bash
$ ./01_inventory_integrity.py
cosc authentication url: https://198.18.1.25/controller-auth
