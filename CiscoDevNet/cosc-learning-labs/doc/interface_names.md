#Interface Names

by Giles Heron (giheron@cisco.com), 8th May 2015

Typically physical interface names are automatically generated by the box based on the cards in the system.

So e.g. for XR the schema is: InterfaceTypeA/B/C/D where:
* A = rack
* B = slot
* C = module
* D = port

Of course in general rack is 0 (as only one rack). The exception would be multi-chassis CRS or NCS6000.

With ASR9001 there is only one slot, there are 2 modules (0 and 1), and the fixed 10GigE ports are module 2.   So all interfaces start 0/0.

With XRv of course there are no racks/slots/modules so all interfaces start 0/0/0.

Management interfaces vary depending on the box type.  for ASR9K it’s e.g. MgmtEth0/RSP0/CPU0/0.  For XRv it’s MgmtEth0/0/CPU0/0.
 
With IOS it depends on the box.  Interfaces may be InterfaceTypeD, InterfaceTypeB/D, InterfaceType C/D, or InterfaceType B/C/D.   It gets “fun” when you have controllers (e.g. for channelised TDM ports) and the interface names start to get colons in.

Logical interfaces such as tunnels, loopbacks, bundle-ethers, dialers etc. are just InterfaceTypeX

NX-OS interfaces are named InterfaceTypeB/D.
