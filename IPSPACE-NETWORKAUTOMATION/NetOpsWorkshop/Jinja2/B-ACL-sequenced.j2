{#
  This example no longer works in Jinja2 2.9 and later.

  Jinja2 changed variable scoping rules within for loops - prior to
  release 2.9 the variable set within a for loop retained their
  value across loop iterations. Starting with release 2.9 the 
  variables are reinitialized at everz iteration of the loop.
