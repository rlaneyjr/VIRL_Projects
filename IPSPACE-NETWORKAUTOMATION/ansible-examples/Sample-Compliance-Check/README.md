# Execute a battery of compliance checks and create a report

This directory contains the source code for the _Compliance Checks_ video in the [Creating Summary and Compliance Reports](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetAutSol&module=2#M2S2) part of [Building Network Automation Solutions](http://www.ipspace.net/Building_Network_Automation_Solutions) online course.

The code has been refactored to produce a compliance error report based on Ansible playbook results collected with JSON callback (described in the _Putting It All Together_ part of the course).
